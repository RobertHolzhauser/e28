# Project 1
+ By: Robert Holzhauser
+ Production URL: <http://e28p1.success-tools.club>

## Outside resources
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  I used Bootstrap css, in particular the grid system for layout.
[VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) I used the Vue.js guide, api, and other documentation on the Vue site.


## Notes for instructor
This is a semi approximation of BlackJack, with random number rolls from 1 to 21 instead of cards.  
This is a pure game of chance with virtually no skill involved, so the computer handles all of the
"rolls".  The idea is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
